## Progenetix

### Resource description

The Progenetix resource is centered around our collection of >130'000 CNV profiles
from cancer related genomic profiling experiments - mostly from re-processing  of 
genomic arrays from resources sucgh as NCBI GEO, but including text-based CNV profiling data
e.g. from chromosomal CGH or NGS based studies.

Technically, Progenetix employs a custom implementation of the Beacon API on top
of a MongoDB backend.
